         <p>I had the opportunity to take my daughter, Layla, on a trip to Los Angeles, California this year for spring
            break!
            This trip had been in the works for a long time.
            We had everything completely planned out last year, but unfortunately COVID-19 had different plans! </p>

         <p >  We rescheduled our long awaited trip for this year.
            We had airline miles and AirBnB credits that were expiring any day! It was now, or never!! </p>

         <p>I found the perfect place to stay! We were only two blocks from the beach
            and we had two bicycles that were ours to use for the entire week!!! It doesn’t get much better than
            that when you’re vacationing during a pandemic! </p>

         <p > We spent the whole week exploring. We visited a few different
            beaches in the area. We took the bikes to the Venice Skate Parks and the Santa Monica Pier.
            Layla even had a surfing lesson before we made our way back home to St. Louis. </p>

         <p> It was the perfect vacation. It was so nice to get to spend some quality time with my
            daughter before she heads to high school next year.
